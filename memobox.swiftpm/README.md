# Meet Pepo

Special thanks to Munhoz, Fonsi, Alves, Felps and Flora who helped me.  
Special thanks to Yerik (I spied some parts of your WWDC AR game hehehe).  
Special thanks to all my mentors, with the AlbumCover.swiftpm (who helped me with the icon pop and physics).

## Description

Meet Pepo is an iOS app that lets you explore a personalized collection of 3D models related to my tastes and interests—such as game characters, anime figures, and collectible items. The app offers interactive model viewing, detailed descriptions, sound playback, and an Augmented Reality (AR) experience.

All of the sounds and models I used are free and were not created by me. You can find all the source links in the `links_credit.txt` file at the root of the project.

The assets available in `Assets.xcassets` and in the `Images` folder were created by me in Figma and with ChatGPT. Please give credit if you use my icon from `Assets.xcassets`.
