Berserk is my favorite story, has my favorite characters and is my favorite manga on my bookshelf. Many people ask me why and thinks i'm a weirdo since it's a 18+ book. But the meaning of this book for me it's deeper than people think. The manga is not just about death, about crimes or blood. It's about betrayal, punishment, innocence and how life can beat you up and you still stand up. I read it when I was going through a rough time in life and it helped me alot and since then I always see life as a constant challenge that I can keep sharpening myself through. Guts (the protagonist) suffers a lot due to the plot of the story but still stands up to the challenges that comes infront of him.
